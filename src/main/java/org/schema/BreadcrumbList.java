/**
 * 
  *       A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.
  *       <br />
  *       <br />
  *       The 'position' property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList.
  *       The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an itemListOrder of ItemListOrderAscending (lower values listed first), and that the
  *       first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage.
  *       The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning
  *       with '1' for the first item in the list.
  *

      Many (but not all) pages have a fairly clear primary topic, some entity or thing that the page describes. For
      example a restaurant's home page might be primarily about that Restaurant, or an event listing page might
      represent a single event. The mainEntity and mainEntityOfPage properties allow you to explicitly express the relationship

      to a page that indirectly identifies it. Whereas sameAs emphasises well known pages, the mainEntityOfPage property

      describes some other entity. For example, one web page may display a news article about a particular person.
      Another page may display a product review for a particular product. In these cases, mainEntity for the pages
